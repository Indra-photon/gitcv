# Resume Formatting Guide

## Using Markdown for Text Formatting

Your resume editor now supports **rich text formatting** using simple markdown syntax. You can bold, italicize, and emphasize text directly in the editor.

---

## Supported Formatting

### **Bold Text**
Make text bold to emphasize important keywords, technologies, or achievements.

**How to use:**
- Type `**text**` or `__text__`
- Example: `Built a **scalable** microservices architecture`
- Result: Built a **scalable** microservices architecture

**When to use bold:**
- ✅ Important technologies: `**React**, **Node.js**, **AWS**`
- ✅ Key metrics: `Increased performance by **40%**`
- ✅ Critical achievements: `**Led a team of 5 developers**`
- ✅ Action verbs: `**Developed**, **Implemented**, **Optimized**`

---

### **Italic Text**
Use italics for subtle emphasis or to highlight terms.

**How to use:**
- Type `*text*` or `_text_`
- Example: `Implemented *continuous integration* pipeline`
- Result: Implemented *continuous integration* pipeline

**When to use italic:**
- ✅ Technical terms: `Used *microservices architecture*`
- ✅ Soft skills: `Demonstrated *leadership* and *communication*`

---

### **Combining Bold and Italic**
You can combine both for extra emphasis.

**How to use:**
- Type `***text***` or `**_text_**`
- Example: `***Critical feature*** delivered on time`
- Result: ***Critical feature*** delivered on time

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ **DO:**
- **Highlight key achievements:** `Reduced load time by **50%**`
- **Emphasize important tech:** `Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **GraphQL**`
- **Make metrics stand out:** `Managed **$2M budget** and **10+ team members**`
- **Bold action verbs:** `**Architected** and **deployed** cloud infrastructure`

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- **Over-format:** Don't make every word bold - it loses impact
- **Mix too many styles:** Keep it professional and clean
- **Format entire sentences:** Only highlight key parts

## Tips for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)

While formatting improves readability, remember:
- ✅ Use formatting to **highlight** key skills and achievements
- ✅ ATS systems can still read the text content
- ✅ **Bold keywords** make your resume easier to scan for recruiters
- ⚠️ Don't rely only on formatting - content is most important
